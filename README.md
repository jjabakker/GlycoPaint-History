The Pipeline, presented here, is a research application to extract information from the GlycoPaint recordings. The pipeline is a collection of Python and R scripts and depends heavily on Fiji and TrackMate.

To assist with installing the components of the pipeline, [Installation instructions](doc/Installation.md) are provided.

An overview of the functionality of the pipeline and how to use it is provided in the [Paint Pipeline Documentation](doc/Paint_Pipeline_Documentation.md).
