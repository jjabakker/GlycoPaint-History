# Paint Processing Pipeline

Glycopaint experiments generate multi frame images from which data needs to be retrieved. The Paint Processing Pipeline uses the Trackmate plugin to construct tracks that represents binding events.


The pipeline has been developed as a special purpose tool to process glyco binding experiments in Leiden. With the code as provided, adjustments can be relatively easily made to adjust to different, similar, requirements.
